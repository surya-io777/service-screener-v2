# Screener Scheduler Guide
Today, you can setup scheduler to run screener automatically at fix schedule. Follow the setup guide below to deloy.

## Deployment Guide
### Prerequisite - Permission
1. AWS User ID to log into AWS Console
1. <TODO> Permission required
1. 

### Cloudshell
The deployment requires 1/ CDK, 2/ git, 3/ docker and 4/ aws-cli. Using AWS Cloudshell is the cleanest way to deploy.
1. Login to AWS Console
1. Access Cloudshell
1. Run the following commands
```
python3 -m venv .
source bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
rm -rf service-screener-v2
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/service-screener-v2.git
cd service-screener-v2
pip install -r requirements.txt

cd usecases/scheduler/src/infra
cdk bootstrap
cdk deploy
```

## Configuration
The configuration setup is to be done in DynamoDB, a table called: <TODO>
- name (string, key): unique configurationId
- frequency (string): cron syntax
- emails (stringset): list of recipients to receive Screener reports
- regions (stringset): valid [list of regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html). e.g: ap-southeast-1 | us-east-1 | ALL
- services (stringset, optional): leave it empty to scan all supported services, else you can refers to [list of valid services here](https://github.com/aws-samples/service-screener-v2/tree/main/services)
- crossAccounts (string, optional): need to upload a valid crossAccounts.json here. You can refers to [this sample](https://github.com/aws-samples/service-screener-v2/blob/main/crossAccounts.sample.json) or [follows this](https://github.com/aws-samples/service-screener-v2/tree/main/usecases/accountsWithinOrganization) to generate the json if the list of accounts are within the same Organization.

## Troubleshooting
### CDK Deploy Failed
1. <TODO>
1. <TODO>
1. <TODO>

### Invalid Cron
1. Check logs in cloudwatch in the configUpdater lambda to identify error
1. Make sure your cron is in valid format, you may tap on [this site](https://www.freeformatter.com/cron-expression-generator-quartz.html) to understand better
1. Go to dynamodb and update the *frequency*. The value should consists *cron(YOUR_PATTERN)*, e.g: cron(* * * ? * 1 *)

### Not receiving reporter email
1. Check logs in cloudwatch in the resultProcesser lambda to identify error
1. Next you can go to the S3 Bucket to check if file exists. The key should have the following pattern <bucketname>/<dynamodbKey>/<YYYYMMDD>/<AWS_ACCOUNTID>/workItem.xlsx ... if files not exists, likely AWS Batch does not run properly due to configuration or permission errros, go to next step
1. Next you can go to AWS Batch to look for any jobs' errors
1. Next you can go to AWS SNS, select topic with prefix, make sure you subscribe to the email notification
